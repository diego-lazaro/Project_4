# Synopsis
Analyze the amount of aresnic contaimination in water for the United States.

# Data processing 
This dataset is intended to represent the potable ground-water resource.
This dataset therefore does not include thermal and saline water (temperature greater than 50℃ or dissolved solids greater than 3000 ㎎/L or specific conductance greater than 4000 µS/㎝).
In addition, this dataset includes only the most recent arsenic analysis available for each well, and only analyses performed by hydride generation or ICP/MS.
